Good afternoon Sir/Madam,

I would like to explain a test scenario that i have worked with JPM Chase before. Kindly, review the test case and let me
know the feed back.

Project: The title of our projectwas Mobile SDK, which is a service provider forboth iOS and Android. There are two applications
to test the mobile SDK.
1. TCV which is a dummy merchant application
2. Chasepay which is a real application. Here, we will validate login to merchant and enable user then it redirects to chasepay.We
enable the login for the first time and continue with the flow.

Storey 1: Enablement flow
1.Login to TCV with the given username and passowrd and we will be redirected to chasepay app
2.Navigate to terms and conditions page.
3.Enter the username and password.
4.And we will be redirected to "request identification code" page
5.Enter the identification code and proceed
6.Then you will be logging in to the application.

Storey 2: Payment page
1. Login to the application
2. Then we will see options like home, order, pay, merchants and more.
3. click on "pay" button
4. Then we will be navigated to pay page.
5. When we clickon the pay page, we see four options called "QR code loading", "Chasepay Freedom cards", "at the cashier", "at the pump".
6. When we click on "at the cashier"button.
7. Then we will see "Chase Freedom cards".
